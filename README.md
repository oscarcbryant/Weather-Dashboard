# Weather-Dashboard
An interactive dashboard showing weather updates for cities around the world.
The weather dashboard exercise was highly challenging but a great deal of new skills was accomplished as a result of this assigment. 

Firstly, we started to understand the fundamentals of scoping - ie where in js to log variables & calling of functions so that the js code reads the values correctly.
We faced issues which were caused by only minor errors by way of the scoping and positioning of our code. A simple fix and something to look out for in future. 

The api calling was a fun component of this exercise. We got to use api's in real time. In this case, we used a weather application available via the my weather app to pull data from the page. 
we learnt how to call these apis and then build functions around these apis so that data can be retrived.

We started to understand more about the role of objects against functions - ie:

 displayTodaysWeather(data.list[i], city); provides us with:
 
 a) the array data from the api (ie list) at every 8th interval (ie, i)
 b) the specific 'city' data located within the api, relating to the city selected from the user field.
 
 We then used these key values to create other objects in other functions that were calling from the (data.list, city) values we created. 
 It was important to our learning that we understood how these values intergrated, as this was critical to us successfully rendering information on the page. 
 
 We successfully deployed a for loop to set data for the upcoming 5 day forecast as well. 
 
However, we still have more to do on this project, including:

Setting UV's color to change as per the rating of UV index
Remembering selections and saving them to local storage so the page maintains these on the browser
Seperating for loop's effect on the first block
styling and polish - ensure page meets requirements aesthetically as per the brief. 

We'll continue to work on this assignment and attempt to fulfill the remaining requirements over the coming weeks.

Thanks,
Oscar
